This repo contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a greeting. However, when the function is called with an array of strings, a type error occurs because the function expects a single string argument. The solution demonstrates how to fix this error by either modifying the function to accept an array of strings or by modifying the function call to pass a single string argument.
